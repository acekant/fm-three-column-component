## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge, I improved my understanding of **Tailwind's spacing utilities** and **flexbox layouts**. One key takeaway was how to efficiently align items using `space-x-*` and `space-y-*` utilities.

```html
<div class="flex flex-col space-y-4">
  <div class="p-4 bg-orange-500">Card 1</div>
  <div class="p-4 bg-blue-500">Card 2</div>
</div>
```

### Continued development

Going forward, I want to:

- Work on **more complex layouts** using Tailwind Grid.
- Improve **accessibility practices**.
- Learn about **Tailwind's JIT mode** for optimization.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me understand spacing and flexbox utilities.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) - Great place to practice real-world UI challenges.
